issue:
======
https://github.com/warren-bank/HLS-Proxy/issues/25

summary:
========

* previously:
    ./01. location of embedded URLs.txt
  it was assumed that:
  - the URL for a child manifest immediately follows a line containing the tag:
      #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:
  - the URL for a media segment immediately follows a line containing the tag:
      #EXTINF:

* the previous assumptions govern how the manifest parser extracts URLs
  in HLS Proxy, versions:
  - v3.0.0 through v3.2.4 (the most recent release)

* this user has observed a manifest that violate these assumptions
  - the URL for a media segment does not immediately follow the given tag
  - there are one (or more) unrelated tags in-between the given tag and the URL
  - ex:
      #EXTINF:6.0000,
      #EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME:2022-12-22T05:58:45.714499+00:00

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

referring back to the spec:
===========================

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8216#section-4.1

* Each line is a URI, is blank, or starts with the character '#'.
  Blank lines are ignored.
  Whitespace MUST NOT be present, except for elements in which it is explicitly specified.

* Lines that start with the character '#' are either comments or tags.
  Tags begin with #EXT. They are case sensitive.
  All other lines that begin with '#' are comments and SHOULD be ignored.

* A URI line identifies a Media Segment or a Playlist file.
  Each Media Segment is specified by a URI and the tags that apply to it.

* A Playlist is a Media Playlist if all URI lines in the Playlist identify Media Segments.
  A Playlist is a Master Playlist if all URI lines in the Playlist identify Media Playlists.
  A Playlist MUST be either a Media Playlist or a Master Playlist; all other Playlists are invalid.

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8216#section-4.3.4.2

* The URI line that follows the EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag specifies a Media Playlist.
  Its format is:
    #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:<attribute-list>
    <URI>

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8216#section-4.3.2.1

* The EXTINF tag specifies the duration of a Media Segment.
  It applies only to the next Media Segment.
  This tag is REQUIRED for each Media Segment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

observations:
=============

* the spec does NOT require that the URI line for a Media Segment
  "immediately" follow the EXTINF tag

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

methodology for next iteration of v3.x manifest parser:
=======================================================

* the following are features of the manifest structure,
  which are required by the spec:
  - #EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag:
    * indicates that the manifest is a Master Playlist
    * must occur before any URI lines
    * all URI lines in manifest identify Media Playlists
      - ie: child manifests (m3u8)
  - #EXTINF tag:
    * indicates that the manifest is a Media Playlist
    * must occur before any URI lines
    * all URI lines in manifest identify Media Segments
      - ie: media segments (ts)

* methodology for parser:
  - determine type of playlist by looking for the first occurance
    in a manifest of either tag: #EXT-X-STREAM-INF or #EXTINF
  - once the type of playlist is determined,
    all URI lines in the manifest must be of a single type
   * #EXT-X-STREAM-INF
     - determines: Master Playlist
     - URI lines:  child manifests (m3u8)
   * #EXTINF
     - determines: Media Playlist
     - URI lines:  media segments (ts)
